Motion Tracking:

- Prior to running the simulation, please ensure the boolean value for the Supervisor parameter of the E-Puck is set to True. This allows the simulation to be automatically
  recorded.

- Motion Tracking occurrs automatically after the simulation has been run. Please note, the tracking program may take a while to process the video, and produce the output 
  video demonstrating the motion tracking. Please wait for the terminal to display "Controller exited successfully" prior to attempting to open the output file 
  "Motion_tracking.mp4".
